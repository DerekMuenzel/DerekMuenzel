- 👋 Hi, I’m @DerekMuenzel
- 👀 I’m interested in coding. One day I would like to make an incremental game, a JRPG like Dragon Quest I-IV, and a strategy game like Romance of the Three Kingdoms II all in a 16/32-bit pixel aesthetic.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now but who knows in the future.
- 📫 How to reach me: message me through github.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: There are 10 types of people in the world. Those that understand binary and those that do not.
